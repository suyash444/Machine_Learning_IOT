This project focuses on optimizing machine learning models for IoT (Internet of Things) applications. We tackle challenges involving low latency, limited memory, and network communication protocols. The work is divided into three key modules:

âœ… Voice Activity Detection (VAD) system optimized for IoT devices.

ðŸ”‹ Battery Monitoring System designed for memory efficiency.

ðŸ”— IoT Communication Protocols using MQTT and REST for real-time data handling.

Each component demonstrates the integration of machine learning with resource-constrained environments, highlighting both technical feasibility and practical implementation.

ðŸ“¦ Modules
1. Voice Activity Detection (VAD) System
Implements a custom Python-based binary classifier for speech detection (Yes/No).

Optimized for accuracy and low latency.

Designed for resource-limited IoT devices (e.g., edge sensors, Raspberry Pi).

2. Battery Monitoring for IoT
Memory-efficient system to monitor battery levels and health.

Implements lightweight data handling to ensure minimal resource usage.

Ideal for long-duration IoT deployments with power constraints.

3. MQTT & REST Protocol Comparison
Demonstrates real-time IoT data collection and communication.

Compares MQTT vs REST in terms of performance, overhead, and scalability.

Highlights practical use cases and trade-offs in dynamic IoT environments.

ðŸš€ Technologies Used
Python (NumPy, Scikit-learn, PyAudio)

MQTT (Mosquitto Broker)

REST (Flask API)
